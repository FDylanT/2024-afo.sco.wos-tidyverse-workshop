# Journey into the `tidyverse`

The code contained in tidyverse-ornith.Rmd (rendered HTML to come [here]()) provides a walkthrough of wrangling and visualising elements of a mock dataset using many different functions from packages contained within the [`tidyverse`[(https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, `readr`, and the ever-wonderful `ggplot2` among others.

The official cheatsheets for each core `tidyverse` package and a couple of bonus ones can be found at the links below:
* [Data visualization with `ggplot2`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf)
* [Data transformation with `dplyr`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf)
* [Data tidying with `tidyr`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/tidyr.pdf) (+ a snippet dedicated to `tibble`)
* [Data import with `readr`, `readxl` & `googlesheets4`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-import.pdf) -- note that `readxl` and `googlesheets4` are not "core" `tidyverse` packages and so must be individually loaded (e.g. `library(readxl)`).
* [Applying functions with `purrr`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/purrr.pdf)
* [String manipulation with `stringr`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/strings.pdf)
* [Handling factors with `forcats`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/factors.pdf)

Bonus:
* [Handling dates and times with `lubridate`](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/lubridate.pdf) -- must also be individually loaded via `library(lubridate)`
