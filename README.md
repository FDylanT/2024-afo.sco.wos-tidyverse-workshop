# Journey into the `tidyverse`

The code contained in tidyverse-ornith.Rmd (rendered HTML to come [here]) provides a walkthrough of wrangling and visualising elements of a mock dataset using many different functions from packages contained within the `tidyverse`, including `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `stringr`, `readr`, and the ever-wonderful `ggplot2` among others.

The official cheatsheets for each core `tidyverse` package can be found at the links below:
* `ggplot2`
* `dplyr`
* `tidyr` & `tibble`
* `readr` (& `readxl` & `googlesheets4`)
* `purrr`
* `stringr`
* `forcats`
